I'm quite forgetful, so it's necessary for me to jot down some notes from time to time.  This blog is the result.
When writing the posts, the main reader in my mind is often me myself.  If you happen to find something helpful to you, my pleasure.

Most of the posts here are about topics I am interested in:
+ GNU Emacs
+ GUN/Linux
+ Compilers
+ Blockchain
+ System Programming
+ Learning Japanese


Sometimes I practice writing prose as a way to learn (good) English writing.  I am not a native English speaker though.
